# Watchlist

Watchlist is a program that allows you to access information about several tv shows and movies. If you are a member of watchlist, you can also add, change and delete tv shows as well as movies. It is basically a big data-based program. 

## Getting Started

Since watchlist does not run on a server yet, no special deployement is needed. 

### Prerequisites

All you need to run our program at this point is the Java-IDE eclipse SimRel and Java 11.0.1

## Running the tests

We implemented some Unit-tests for our Controllers and Services (Web- / Service-Layers). These have run without any issues until now.
